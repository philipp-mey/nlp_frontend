1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 Every day, billions of people come here with questions about all kinds of things.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
 Sometimes we even get questions about Google search itself, like how this whole thing actually

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,280
 works.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,200
 And while this is a subject entire books have been written about, there's a good chance

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,360
 you're in the market for something a little more concise.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,960
 So let's say it's getting close to dinner and you want a recipe for lasagna.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,440
 You've probably seen this before, but let's go a little deeper.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 Since the beginning, back when the homepage looked like this, Google has been continuously

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,760
 mapping the web, hundreds of billions of pages, to create something called an index.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,960
 Think of it as the giant library we look through whenever you do a search for lasagna or anything

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
 else.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
 Now, the word lasagna shows up a lot on the web.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,080
 Pages about the history of lasagna, articles by scientists whose last name happened to

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,880
 be lasagna, stuff other people might be looking for.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,560
 But if you're hungry, randomly clicking through millions of links is no fun.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 This is where Google's ranking algorithms come into play.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,000
 First, they try to understand what you're looking for, so they can be helpful even if

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,520
 you don't know exactly the right words to use or if your spelling is a little off.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,880
 Then they sift through millions of possible matches in the index and automatically assemble

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
 a page that tries to put the most relevant information up top for you to choose from.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
 Okay, now we have some results.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
 But how did the algorithms actually decide what made it onto the first page?

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,040
 There are hundreds of factors that go into ranking search results, so let's talk about

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,360
 a few of them.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,480
 You may already know that pages containing the words you search for are more likely to

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
 end up at the top.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,200
 No surprise there.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,120
 But the location of those words, like in the page's title or in an image's caption,

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
 those are factors too.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,280
 There's a lot more to ranking than just words.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,440
 Like when Google got started, we looked at how pages linked to each other to better understand

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,360
 what pages were about and how important and trustworthy they seemed.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,080
 Today, linking is still an important factor.

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,840
 Another factor is location, where a search happens.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,960
 Because if you happen to be in Ormea, Italy, you might be looking for information about

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,160
 their annual lasagna festival.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,280
 But if you're in Omaha, Nebraska, you probably aren't.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,960
 When a webpage was uploaded is an important factor too.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,960
 Scammers published more recently often have more accurate information, especially in the

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,800
 case of a rapidly developing news story.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,600
 Of course, not every site on the web is trying to be helpful.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,680
 Just like with robocalls on your phone or spam in your email, there are a lot of sites

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,840
 that only exist to scam, and every day scammers upload millions more of them.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,880
 So just because InstantVirusDownload.net lists the words lasagna recipe 400 times, that doesn't

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,800
 mean it's going to help you make dinner.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,640
 We spend a lot of time trying to stay one step ahead of tricks like these, making sure

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,440
 our algorithms can recognize scam sites and flag them before they make it to your search

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,160
 results page.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,880
 So let's review.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,040
 Billions of times a day, whenever someone searches for a lasagna, or resume writing tips,

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,840
 or how to swaddle a baby, or anything else, Google's software locates all the potentially

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,080
 relevant results on the web, removes all the spam, and ranks them based on hundreds of

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 factors like keywords, links, location, and freshness.

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
 Okay, good time to take a breath.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,680
 This last part is about how we make changes to search, and it's important.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,200
 Since 1998, when Google went online, people seem to have found our results pretty helpful.

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,360
 But the web is always changing, and people are always searching for new things.

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,880
 In fact, one in every seven searches is for something that's never been typed into the

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,480
 search box before, by anyone, ever.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,240
 So we're always working in updates to search, thousands every year.

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,360
 Which brings up a big question.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
 How do we decide whether a change is making search more helpful?

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,280
 Well, one of the ways we evaluate potential updates to search is by asking people like

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
 you.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,200
 Every day, thousands of search quality raters look at samples of search results side by

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,600
 side, then give feedback about the relevance and reliability of the information.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,880
 To make sure those evaluations are consistent, the raters follow a list of search quality

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,800
 evaluator guidelines.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,040
 Think of them as our publicly available guide to what makes a good result good.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,360
 Oh, and one last thing to remember.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,640
 We use responses from raters to evaluate changes, but they don't directly impact how search

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,160
 results are ranked.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
 So there you have it.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,440
 Every time you click search, our algorithms are analyzing the meaning of the words in

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,240
 your search, matching them to the content on the web, understanding what content is most

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,160
 likely to be helpful and reliable, and then automatically putting it all together in a

77
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,720
 neatly organized page designed to get you the info you need.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 All in?

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 Oh, .81 seconds?

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
 Wow.

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 Anyone else ready for dinner?

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
