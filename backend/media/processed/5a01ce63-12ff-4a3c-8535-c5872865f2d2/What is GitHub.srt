1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 What do you mean, what is GitHub?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:11,640
 It's the largest, most complete development platform in the world.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,680
 Millions of developers use it, and it's not just developers.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,120
 These days, every company is a software company.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,160
 I thought you might say that.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,440
 Come on, let me show you.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,200
 It's an enterprise-transforming, start-up launching,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,360
 community-driven, super-secure, open-source championing,

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
 cloud-based platform.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,600
 It's where the world builds software.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,080
 We created algorithms.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,880
 And global businesses.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
 We even want some Mars.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,920
 Or at least our code dead.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,400
 Oh, yes.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,160
 With GitHub, anything is possible.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
 But how?

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,000
 Say this is Sonal, a senior software engineer.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
 And this is a team's project on GitHub.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
 Sonal and a team can create their own branches of code

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
 to work together in parallel.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,240
 This is my branch, an alternate timeline

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,160
 where I can build squash bugs and safely experiment.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,080
 There are communication and task delegation

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,200
 tools right next to my code.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,160
 So when we're ready to merge, we merge instantly.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,200
 It works with thousands of branches

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,160
 for over a million projects.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,560
 And with built-in project planning, automation,

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
 CI-CD, and AI-enhanced code editing at every step.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,840
 You can move fast and get your ducks in a row.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,840
 But we've got to be safe about it.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,160
 GitHub has advanced security of automatic vulnerability

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,400
 detection, secret scanning, and more.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,160
 So we can build and ship safely and securely.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,360
 So now you know what GitHub is.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,480
 You might wonder who GitHub is.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,640
 It's a student learning to code.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 It's disruptors revolutionizing music.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
 It's a CEO transforming a global company.

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,600
 It's 21,000 strangers working together

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,160
 to take the first picture of a black hole.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,440
 It's a place for anyone from any way to build anything.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,120
 Anything you think the world needs.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
 What's that?

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,840
 You already knew that?

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
 Why didn't you say anything?

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
 I was talking for ages back there.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,760
 It's embarrassing.
